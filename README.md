# ordering
An event driven approach to ordering built with .NET and Kafka

To run, make sure you have the docker engine running and the .NET 8 runtime installed. With that done, do the following:

1. Run dotnet build - compiles the project.
2. Run dotner run - to launch the project ans fire up a container for hosting SQL Server.

Alternatively, start the project within Visual Studio.
